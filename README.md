Backtrack solves a simple problem that I faced whilst producing some music: it's really hard to keep track of the latest version of a song. Backtrack solves this problem by providing the user a simple yet powerful tool customised to this exact experience.

> "Think of it like the GitHub of music. Now there's no need for thousands of emails back-and-forth." ~ Tika (Founder)

So what are you waiting for? Check it out [here](https://backtrack.7ika.dev?referer=github).

Future plans include:

- Collaboration – work in sync with other musicians. Don't worry about making changes that someone else has already completed!
- Better workflow with DAWs – we know your time is valuable!
- Tutorials, blogs & UX – we want to provide a better experience to those who love our app.
- Merging branches – different ideas should be able to be combined in a project.
- Pricing model – better features, more storage, quicker uploads?

### Conclusion

My vision for this app is not to replace others. It's not supposed to be a music creation service, nor is it supposed to just be a collaboration service. This is a framework, a concept, a building block: all musicians using digital files _should_ be using Backtrack – no longer will youo have to make use of hundreds of identical folders/files & emails when just creating music.

You might also ask "so why just music? why not other walks of life: like video editing?". We'll see what the future holds, but I hand crafted this app with a particular scenario in mind and I have successfully fufilled that need!

## Frontend App

This repository features a version of the Backtrack desktop application written in Electron x NextJS 13. Due to issues with `nextron`, this repository has been abandoned in favour of a private repo written using NextJS 12 (and subsequently, using `/pages` instead of `/app`).

## Backend

A repository hosting a non-updating version of the backend can be located [here](https://github.com/tika/backtrack-backend). Please note this may contain bugs, if you're interested in contributing to Backtrack, please reach out to my email explaining why you'd be a good fit for this project: [captika@outlook.com](mailto:captika@outlook.com).

A list of all the endpoints can be found [here](https://tika.notion.site/API-216a9320f71c417ebf224fd2abfe2a29?pvs=4).

Cheers! That's all for now,
